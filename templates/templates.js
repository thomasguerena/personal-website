I grew up playing computer games, but didn\'t touch a line of code until my sophomore year of college. A friend recommended I take an intro C++ course for fun, and three months later I changed my major from sociology to computer science. Eventually, I added a minor in mathematics (because it\'s awesome). Having absolutely no background in math or computer science, I had a lot of catching up to do. Luckily, I didn\'t just enjoy it, I was good at it and the rest of college was fun and rewarding.</p>\n<p class="body-text">In the summer of 2012, I took an internship at Vernier Software.

As the most experienced Javascript programmer, I was made technical lead. My additional responsibilities included designing the library API, setting general code standards, and helping others adjust to the language.\nYou can read more about the project on <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/backing-up-user-data-on-firefox-os/" target="_blank">Mozilla\'s blog</a>, but I\'ll summarize.</p>\n<br>\n<p class="body-text">Mozilla created an inexpensive smart phone which uses HTML5 to create an OS (along with Linux and some supporting C). Although you\'ve probably never seen a Firefox phone, they are hugely popular in developing nations. For those that own them, their phones are often their primary/only computer. The problem is many of the early phones (the ones most prevalent) don\'t have a built-in backup functionality, and they get completely wiped when you install an update. That\'s a huge pain for normal users - devastating for small businesses.</p>\n<br>\n<p class="body-text">Our task was to create a backup/restore application that could use external storage methods rather than services requiring an internet connection. Since SD cards are the go-to storage device in developing nations, it was the clear winner. We decided writing a library would be more useful than an application, and we were able to budget enough time to build a demo application to showcase our functionality. The project went very well and Mozilla is hoping to integrate our library into the OS in the next couple of updates.</p>\n<br>\n<p class="body-text">Check out the code <a href="https://github.com/dcobbley/capstone-e">here</a>.</p>';}return __p};
