<p class="body-text">As part of my senior capstone project at Portland State University, my seven teammates and I built a backup/restore Javascript library for Firefox OS. As the most experienced Javascript programmer, I was made technical lead. My additional responsibilities included designing the library API, setting general code standards, and helping others adjust to the language.
You can read more about the project on <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/backing-up-user-data-on-firefox-os/" target="_blank">Mozilla's blog</a>, but I'll summarize.</p>
<br>
<p class="body-text">Mozilla created an inexpensive smart phone which uses HTML5 to create an OS (along with Linux and some supporting C). Although you've probably never seen a Firefox phone, they are hugely popular in developing nations. For those that own them, their phones are often their primary/only computer. The problem is many of the early phones (the ones most prevalent) don't have a built-in backup functionality, and they get completely wiped when you install an update. That's a huge pain for normal users - devastating for small businesses.</p>
<br>
<p class="body-text">Our task was to create a backup/restore application that could use external storage methods rather than services requiring an internet connection. Since SD cards are the go-to storage device in developing nations, it was the clear winner. We decided writing a library would be more useful than an application, and we were able to budget enough time to build a demo application to showcase our functionality. The project went very well and Mozilla is hoping to integrate our library into the OS in the next couple of updates.</p>
