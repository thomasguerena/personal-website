<p class="body-text">I spent a little over a year at <a href="http://www.vernier.com/">Vernier</a> researching new technologies, performing various software maintenance and bug fixes on embedded linux systems, and building the LabQuest 2 updater which is still in use and serving thousands of customers. I had little previous programming experience, so my first few months at Vernier felt like an educational flash flood of industry practices. I was taught development basics such as source control (git and svn), development strategies like agile (scrum, specifically), just enough about linux build systems like Yocto to get myself in trouble, and 13 months of glib and gtk+ experience.</p>
<br>
<p class="body-text">Initially, I was only supposed to stay for a summer internship. Luckily, I got to stay on for the rest of the year. I can't say enough about the engineers I worked with - brilliant but humble, helpful but not hand-holding, and suprisingly good at volleyball. My hope is that they instilled some of that wisdom and behavior in me.</p>

<p class="body-text">A huge <i>thank you</i> to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ian-honohan/0/267/448">Ian Honahan</a> for helping me with countless GTK+ errors, and also to <a href="http://www.becpdx.org/">BEC</a> for facilitating an excellent internship.</p>
